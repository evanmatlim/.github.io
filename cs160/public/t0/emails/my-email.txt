Hi all,

I hope you're all doing well and not stressing too much about this Thursday's midterm! As I mentioned in our last section, tomorrow's section is optional, so feel free to take the time to sleep in or get some extra studying done. I will still be in Esh 250 at our usual time and would be happy to review any practice questions that you come with. 

That said, as you continue studying in these next couple of days, please don't hesitate to reach out to me with any questions or problems you'd like me to answer/clarify. I'll check my emails consistently leading up to your midterm to offer (almost) real-time support. 

Also, I just wanted to say that you all have been doing great in our sections and I have full faith that you'll be more than prepared when Thursday comes. Good luck with your midterms everyone! 

Best,
Evan
